# Mobile Alerts Website

All sensors registered with the phone application can be monitored online at [http://measurements.mobile-alerts.eu](http://measurements.mobile-alerts.eu). It requires the 'Phone ID', which is a unique identifier for the phone application.

The website is actually pretty good, because it contains all current sensors including their history and all communication events from the phone app. But it also shows the amount of data that is available only protected by a few digits. Especially Door/Window sensors can be security sensitive.
